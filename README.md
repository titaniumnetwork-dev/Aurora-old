# Aurora Proxy
A fast and powerful proxy made in golang. This project has just recently started development and should not be used until official release.

# Deploying Information
I am planning on adding cross architecture docker containers listed on both heroku and dockerhub. These builds will be automated by some sort of CI system that makes a new build of the containers every time a new commit is pushed to the repository. For now you can just use *go run*.
